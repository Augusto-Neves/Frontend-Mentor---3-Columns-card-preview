## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

I had a chance to practice my Flexbox Layout skills by taking this challenge. I was able to use the CSS properties of the flexbox layout as a flex-wrap to build a responsive card without media queries just using flexbox.


### Continued development

I want to learn and use more SCSS and yours properties. SCSS is a greatfull tool to build Cascading Style Sheets faster.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Flexbox Reference - Portuguese-BR](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me with the concepts of flexbox layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it more.
- [Flexbox Complete Guide - Portuguese-BR](https://www.example.com) - This article helped me to understand every propriety of Flexbox Layout. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
